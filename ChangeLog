== 0.1.1

Initial public release. Includes basic helpers for checking element visibility
(should_see, should_not_see etc.) as well as navigation (press, follow,
click_link_in_row), form filling and verification (fill_in_fields,
fields_should_contain, dropdown_should_equal, etc.), with many of these
methods supporting a :within scope.
