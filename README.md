Kelp
====

This project aims to package a collection of useful helper methods for
Cucumber. Currently, the provided methods depend on Capybara, though support
may eventually be added for Webrat, email-spec, or related tools.

The name "Kelp" is a contraction of "Cuke Helpers". It was chosen because it's
short, easy to remember, and is in keeping with the theme of greenish plants.
