Development
===========

If you'd like to hack on Kelp, first fork and clone this repository. Then install
bundler_::

    $ gem install bundler

And then install Kelp's dependencies (specified in ``Gemfile``)::

    $ cd /path/to/kelp
    $ bundle install

It's a good idea to use RVM_ with a new gemset to keep things tidy.

If you make changes that you'd like to share, push them into your Kelp fork,
then submit a pull request.
