Testing
=======

Kelp comes with a ``Rakefile``, so you can run the RSpec tests like so::

    $ rake spec

Since this project is fairly immature and unstable, you can probably expect
some failures. Wanna help fix them?

You can also generate an rcov_ coverage report via::

    $ rake rcov

This will write an HTML report to ``coverage/index.html``.
