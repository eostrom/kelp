====

This is the documentation for Kelp_, a collection of helpers that makes it
easier to write step definitions for Cucumber_. The Kelp gem is hosted on
Rubygems_, so you can install it with::

    $ gem install kelp

The name "Kelp" is a contraction of "Cuke Helpers". It was chosen because it's
short, easy to remember, and is in keeping with the theme of greenish plants.
